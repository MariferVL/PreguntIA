# PreguntIA

Welcome to PreguntIA, your intelligent question-answering chatbot! ðŸ¤–

PreguntIA is a chatbot with the remarkable ability to answer questions based on the information contained within documents, such as plain text (`txt`) or portable document format (`pdf`) files. To bring this capability to life, we leveraged the power of [Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/), an AI-driven tool that extends the functionality of traditional chatbots.
